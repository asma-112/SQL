# California Housing Data Analysis (SQL)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **SQL skills** through a comprehensive analysis of California housing data using **Snowflake**. The main goal was to extract meaningful insights from a large dataset by writing efficient SQL queries, performing aggregations, and summarizing key statistics.
- Wrote SQL queries to:
  - Count the total number of rows  
  - Find minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation of house prices  
  - Calculate average house prices grouped by categorical and numerical features, including:
    - Proximity to the ocean (`ocean_proximity`)  
    - Median age of houses (`housing_median_age`)  
    - Total number of rooms (`total_rooms`)  
    - Population in the area (`population`)  
  - Count the number of houses per ocean proximity category  
- Used **aggregation functions**, **GROUP BY**, and **ORDER BY** clauses to analyze patterns and trends in housing data.  
- Extracted insights to understand how geographic and demographic factors affect housing prices.

## Tools & Platform
- **SQL**: Data querying, aggregation, filtering, and grouping  
- **Snowflake**: Cloud-based data platform for running SQL queries

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Writing **efficient SELECT queries** to retrieve and inspect data  
- Using **aggregate functions**: COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX, STDDEV  
- Applying **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** to summarize and organize data  
- Handling categorical and numerical data in SQL queries  
- Performing data exploration and deriving actionable insights from real-world datasets  
- Using Snowflake for **cloud-based SQL data analysis** and visualization of query results
